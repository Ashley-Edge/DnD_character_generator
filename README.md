This repository forms my DevOps Core Practical Project Specification individual project. At its core, I will be creating an application that generates a random race, class and weapon to help you start your journey in Dungeons & Dragons. I am required to create a service-orientated architecture for my application, this application must be composed of at least 4 services that work together.

The requirements set for the project are below:

- A Kanban board
- An Application fully integrated into GitHub, built through Jenkins and deployed to a GCP virtual machine
- Use Webhooks so that Jenkins recreates and redeploys the changed application from GitHub
- The project must follow the Service-oriented architecture of at least 4 services that work together
- The project must be deployed using Docker and Docker Swarm
- Create an Ansible Playbook that will provide the environment that your application needs to run
- The project must make use of NGINX (reverse proxy) to make your application accessible to the user

You should consider the concept of MVP (Minimum Viable Product) as you plan your project, complete all the requirements before you add extra functionality that is not specified above.
